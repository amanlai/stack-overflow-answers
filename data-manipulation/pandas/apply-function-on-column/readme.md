## How can I use the `apply()` function for a single column?

<sup> This post was originally created as an answer to the following Stack Overflow that can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75264127/19123103).</sup>

I have a pandas dataframe with two columns. I need to change the values of the first column without affecting the second one and get back the whole dataframe with just first column values changed. How can I do that using `apply()` in pandas?
